gcj: -fno-bounds-check -O3 -mfpmath=sse -msse2 -ffast-math -march=native; 

enable all instruction subsets supported by the local machine (hence the result might not run on different machines)

appears you don't need -fomit-frame-pointer on gcc 4.6+:

libfaac is supposed to be poor quality, libaacplus "up there" I believe, but somebody said libfdk-aac was "super high quality" so I must trust them, right? :)

libx264 compilation by one guy:
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/win32_build/lib/pkgconfig ./configure --prefix=$HOME/win32_build --cross-prefix=i586-mingw32msvc- --extra-cflags="-I$HOME/win32_build/include -march=pentium3" --extra-ldflags="-L$HOME/win32_build/lib" --qtsdk=$HOME/qtsdk --host=i586-mingw32msvc

-O3 not recommended for gcc 4.x gentoo [?] but maybe it would work... (it's already enabled in ffmpeg builds)

I think -march=XXX is enough to get away from i386 default land...
is ffmpeg internally using the right sse cpu instructions?

libfaac:./configure --enable-static -disable-shared --prefix=/opt/ffmpegbuildarea/extralibs --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --with-mp4v2=no

libx264 uses this... : -Wshadow -O3 -ffast-math -m32  -Wall -I. -I. -march=i686 -mfpmath=sse -msse -std=gnu99 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-tree-vectorize -fno-zero-initialized-in-bss   -c -o common/pixel.o common/pixel.c

 specifying -march=cpu-type implies -mtune=cpu-type.

specifying graphite stuff?

appears -ffast-math is out [?] but maybe some of its options could be turned on...http://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2010-May/095931.html

-mfpmath=sse looks good for x86 builds at least https://lists.ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2009-August/061883.html possibly our march trick is the wrong way and ffmpeg's configure could have other things

msse4? yeah march doesn't look good enough...http://us.generation-nt.com/gentoo-user-march-native-extremely-conservative-help-205789481.html oh wait it's ok: http://web.archiveorange.com/archive/v/aLshbnQGswttQdr9FRib
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-923520-start-0.html mentions -lfto or something...

license appears ok: License: GPL version 3 or later
